# Transitivity

Transitivity is a free open-source code compatible with Windows, Linux and macOS platforms.
Procedures are made available to evaluate the phenomenology of the temperature dependence of rate constants for processes from the Arrhenius and Transitivity plots.
Reaction rate constants can be calculated by the traditional Transition-State Theory using a set of one-dimensional tunneling corrections (Bell (1935), Bell (1958), Skodje and Truhlar and, in particular, the deformed (d-TST) approach). To account for the solvent effect on reaction rate constant, implementation is given of the Kramers and of Collinsâ€“Kimball formulations.

An input file generator is provided to run various molecular dynamics approaches in CPMD code. Examples are worked out and made available for testing. Images are displayed using GaussView of Gaussian.

### Dependencies

<ul>
<li><b>Numpy</b></li>
<li><b>Matplotlib</b></li>
<li><b>SciPy</b></li>
</ul>

We expect that this code serves as a quick and practical tool for data documentation from electronic structure calculations: It presents a very intuitive graphical interface which we believe to provide an excellent working tool for researchers and as courseware to teach statistical thermodynamics, thermochemistry, kinetics, and related areas.
